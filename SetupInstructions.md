* `pip` (Python package installer)

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/ai-sql-explainer-bot.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/ai-sql-explainer-bot.git)
cd ai-sql-explainer-bot
2. Set Up Python Environment
Create and activate a new Python virtual environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
# source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python libraries. Create a requirements.txt file in your project root with the following content:

Flask
google-generativeai
Markdown
Then, install them:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Configure Gemini API Key
Obtain your Google Gemini API key from Google AI Studio. Open your main application file (e.g., app.py or main.py) and replace the placeholder with your actual key:

Python

# app.py snippet
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" # <--- REPLACE THIS!
▶️ Running the Application
Start the Flask Backend:
In your terminal (with the virtual environment active), run your Flask application file (e.g., python app.py). 🖥️

Bash

python app.py
Access the Web Interface:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (or the port specified by Flask). 🌐

💡 How to Use
Web Interface: Paste your SQL query into the input field, click "Explain SQL", and read the natural language explanation. ✍️
Command-Line (CLI): If a CLI interface is included, run python cli_tool.py "SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 30" (replace cli_tool.py with your actual CLI script). 💻
API (curl): Send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:5000/explain_sql (or your specific API endpoint) with a JSON body containing your SQL query:
Bash

curl -X POST \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"sql_query": "SELECT customer_name FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.id WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 day';"}' \
